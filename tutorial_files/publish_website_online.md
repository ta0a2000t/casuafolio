# Hosting Guide for CasuaFolio

## What is Hosting and Why Do I Need It?

Hosting is the process of making your website accessible over the internet by storing its files on a web server. This makes it accessible to anyone around the world, 24/7. The reason you need hosting is to make your portfolio website available to anyone on the internet, rather than just being a project on your local computer.

## Steps to Host Your Site

### Step 1: **Prepare for Hosting**
1. Navigate to your CasuaFolio project folder in your terminal. The folder should be named `casuafolio` or `casuafolio-main`.
2. Once inside the project folder, run `npm run build` to create a `build` directory. For a video tutorial on this step and the next, see the section below.

### Step 2: **Copy Build Contents**
- Copy the contents of the `build` folder.
